1.	Project instructions

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

•	Find data in Kaggle or other free data. Identify dummy variables and opportunities for data enrichment. If possible, enrich and extend your data. /n
•	Build a mock project and logic model around your tech stack, with behavioral goals for your target audience
•	Include all components listed in the grading rubric

SEGMENT

1.	Build segments and one persona for your best segment group
2.	Using SPSS or other tools, identify marketing segments and provide descriptive statistics. Don’t forget strategies for people you can’t identify/classify.

ENGAGE

1.	Build an ad or email-based marketing funnel for your campaign
2.	Provide an implementable (logical/mathematical) system for matching content to audiences. This can be expressed using funnels, flow charts, sequence diagrams, or other visualizations that show the flow, with rules on how people move from one state to another. 
3.	Author demo content and logical/statistical rules would trigger specific ads, adaptive content, or messages in text/email. (Pseudocode is acceptable, but implementable code is preferred)

PRESENT

•	Present a summary of your business, audiences, funnel, algorithms and content to a presentation, under 20 min. You must include visuals and a walkthrough. There’s a hard cutoff, and you won’t be graded on content you failed to present. So you MUST describe everything in the grading rubric. To be safe. Use the rubric as a structure for your presentation and practice the timing. 
•	After, you’ll have 10 min to discuss it with the professor. 
•	There’s time for an open discussion after. 
•	Format: Any slide presentation you can present. Submit final slides as PDFs for compatibility.
•	Also, have raw printouts for discussions
•	You’re expected to submit a power point slide deck, with statistical sheets as optional submission materials
